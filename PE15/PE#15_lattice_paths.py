"Problem 15 - lattice path"
"Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner."
"what about a 20x20 grid? "

#Suppose it requires N moves to get from A(top left corner) to B(bottom right corner)
#If the grid is an n(across) x m(down) rectangle. 
#Then if N was written as a list of across (A's) and down (D's) it must always contain n x A's and m x D's.
# e.g. A,A,A,D,D,D or A,D,A,D,D,A etc. for a 3x3 grid. 
# Therefore the total number of possible paths can be given by (n+m)C(n).
